Differences from Ian Darwin's File command
(http://www.darwinsys.com/file/) :

- It is not required to backslash escape space characters

- No attempt is made to define queries as binary or text, so queries
  will be applied in the order they appear. file attempts binary queries
  before trying text queries. This may be worth changing at some point.

Currently unsupported magic test types: indirect, der, all id3 types, all middle endian types.
