#lang magic is a Racket implementation of the mini language used by
the Unix file command. The goal is to get as close to 100%
compatibility as possible with Ian Darwin's version(available at
https://www.darwinsys.com/file/) found in most Linux and BSD
distributions. #lang magic is a work in progress. It is missing a lot
of functionality but still has more than enough to be useful.

For the curious, The man pages for 'magic' describes the magic
language in considerable, but not exhaustive, detail. A code sample to
check for Microsoft executables provides the flavor of the language:

---
# MS Windows executables are also valid MS-DOS executables
0           string  MZ
>0x18       leshort <0x40
>>(4.s*512) leshort 0x014c  COFF executable (MS-DOS, DJGPP)
>>(4.s*512) leshort !0x014c MZ executable (MS-DOS)
# skip the whole block below if it is not an extended executable
>0x18       leshort >0x3f
>>(0x3c.l)  string  PE\0\0  PE executable (MS-Windows)
>>>&0       leshort 0x14c   for Intel 80386
>>>&0       leshort 0x184   for DEC Alpha
>>>&0       leshort 0x8664  for AMD64
>>(0x3c.l)  string  LX\0\0  LX executable (OS/2)

The code sample above compiles to one magic query. A #lang magic
Racket module consists of 1 or more such queries. New queries start on
a line without a preceding '>'. Every #lang magic module provides two
functions: magic-query and magic-query-run-all. These functions are
thunks that can be passed to with-input-from-file to test the file
against the queries in the module. magic-query stops and returns true
after the first query match or returns false if no queries pass. A
query is matched if the test on the first line of the query
succeeds. A matched query will run until completion, but even if later
tests in the query fail, the query is still considered a match if the
first test passes. magic-query-run-all will test the file against
every query in the module. Both functions print the messages for each
successful test to the current output port. This is a brief summary,
so consult 'man magic' for a complete explanation.

There is still a lot of work to do. Most of the macros need revising
and should probably be rewritten with syntax/parse. The lexer could be
improved as well. And of course there are missing features, some of
which are documented in the TODO file.

#lang magic has only been tested on Racket 6.11 on Linux. Testing on
other platforms and a current version of Racket are near term
goals.
