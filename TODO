- relative offsets within names are probably broken
- update reverse endianness to reverse indirect offset types(this will
  fix big endian TIFF magic).
- implement regex
- implement independent case insensitive string flags
- add support for relative indirect offsets
- implement full printf substitution in message
- fix macro stepper problems with certain lines
- implement mime and strength lines
- check parsing of minus as negative number when nummask is expected

- rewrite macros in expander.rkt with syntax-parse
- test file's handling of relative offsets in named query (i made
  assumptions)
