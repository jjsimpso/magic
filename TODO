- relative offsets within names are probably broken
- problem with reverse endianness and signed/unsigned
  behavior. reverse endianness currently treats all
  values as unsigned when reversing bytes. may lead
  to compile errors with negative test values.
- update reverse endianness to handle all numeric type parameters
- implement regex
- implement independent case insensitive string flags
- add support for relative indirect offsets
- implement full printf substitution in message
- fix macro stepper problems with certain lines
- implement mime and strength lines
- check parsing of minus as negative number when nummask is expected

- consider a better way to bypass offset macro other than adding
  additional patterns to the line macro
- rewrite macros in expander.rkt with syntax-parse
- test file's handling of relative offsets in named query (i made
  assumptions)
