- verify use with reverse endianness against file's behavior
- fix bug in name-test.rkt with multiple use calls at same level
- allow clear parsing to accept test field
- allow \ escape before ^ (sometimes used in reversed names)
- implement regex
- implement independent case insensitive string flags
- add support for relative indirect offsets
- implement full printf substitution in message
- fix macro stepper problems with certain lines
- implement mime and strength lines
- check parsing of minus as negative number when nummask is expected

- consider a better way to bypass offset macro other than adding
  additional patterns to the line macro
- rewrite macros in expander.rkt with syntax-parse
- test file's handling of relative offsets in named query (i made
  assumptions)
