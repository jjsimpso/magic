- consider what to do about white space after the operator in numeric tests, as in apple.
- zip magic has interesting behavior that may shed light on how 'use' deals with its offset.
  i first discovered this with the jpeg magic but this might explain more about the desired
  behavior. need to fix the use-offset macro.

- relative offsets within names need to be tested
- implement independent case insensitive string flags
- implement full printf substitution in message
- fix macro stepper problems with certain lines
- implement mime and strength lines
- add support for middle endian numeric types
- add support for ID3, GUID, and DER types
- add support for indirect type
