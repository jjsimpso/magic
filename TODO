- catching eof errors is causing some tests to abort without printing
  their message. this could be just an issues with reading to far and
  not stopping at the null character. (i.e. not reading
  byte-by-byte). investigate. example is TIFF name= printing.
- relative offsets within names are probably broken
- update reverse endianness to handle all numeric type parameters
- implement regex
- implement independent case insensitive string flags
- add support for relative indirect offsets
- implement full printf substitution in message
- fix macro stepper problems with certain lines
- implement mime and strength lines
- check parsing of minus as negative number when nummask is expected

- consider a better way to bypass offset macro other than adding
  additional patterns to the line macro
- rewrite macros in expander.rkt with syntax-parse
- test file's handling of relative offsets in named query (i made
  assumptions)
