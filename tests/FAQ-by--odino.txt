Welcome to '221B Baker St.' for the PC, released by Datasoft in 1987. This game
was also released on the Atari 8-bit, AppleII, C64 and AtariST.

A game that plays a little like 'Clue' with Sherlock Holmes characters. It is
based on the board game by the same name. There are thirty cases all having at
least fourteen clues that should be enough for a mystery adventurer to solve
the crime.

Suggestions, comments or errors - tell me about it. Enjoy!

SET-UP:
```````
There are a few questions the game will ask before you start the game.

HOW MANY PLAYERS OR TEAMS? (1-4)  Select the number of players or teams. You
are then prompted to ENTER PLAYER OR TEAM NAME (up to 10 characters). Press
RETURN after typing each name. This game has no online mode, only the choice to
have hotseats.

ARE YOU USING A JOYSTICK? - Y/N  If you wish to play with a Joystick, type Y
otherwise type N.

DO YOU WANT CODED CLUES? - Y/N  This lets you choose whether or not to receive
game clues in a secret code known only to you.

OPTION SUMMARY  If the options you've picked are to your satisfaction, hit Y.
If not, hit N and reselect from the first question.


CODED CLUES:
````````````
  There are 20 Clue Codes, arranged in four CODE groups (A, B, C, D) of five
CODE numbers each. If you decide to play the game using Clue Codes, the
computer assigns you your own Code group (unchangeable for the entire game).
From this, you're given a Code number (changeable during the game).
  For example, the computer assigns you A3; this means you are playing the
whole game in code group "A" and starting off with the Code number of "3".
  Clues appear "scrambled" on the screen. These scrambled letters
correspond with the Alphabet Line (in bold letters) at the left of the
Code groups. The column of letters beneath your Code Number is used to
"decode" the scrambled letters from the Alphabet Line.
  For example, if you've been assigned A1 to play the game and your Clue Code
is EINKL, the letters across from EINKL, spell ADLER.
  The other players may break your Code. This means that while you're
deciphering your clue, they'll be trying to figure it out as well. If it seems
that these cunning code-crackers are on to you, throw them of your scent by
picking a new code number (this is done at the Carriage Depot). There's no
limit to how often you may do this.

         CODE GROUP A    CODE GROUP B    CODE GROUP C    CODE GROUP D

            1 2 3 4 5       1 2 3 4 5       1 2 3 4 5       1 2 3 4 5

CHARACTER SELECTION:
````````````````````
  Each player may choose whom they want to portray: Sherlock Holmes, Dr.
Watson, Irene Adler, or Inspector Lestrade. If you want the computer to call
you by your character name, type that instead of your own at the beginning of
the game. Press Enter after donning the character disguise of your choice.


CASES & LIST:
`````````````
  You simply cannot play 221B Baker St. without reading the cases first.
Every game's case history has vital background information necessary for
solving each abominable atrocity. Even during the game, each player may look up
the case for information. If you do not have the case history that cames with
the game box you can use the ones that comes with this guide, just make sure
no-one unintentionally looks at the clues and solution.

  Use a list to catalogue clues, plan strategies, and to remember where you
have been. Else you will re-visit places and waste time collecting clues.


ROLLING THE DIE:
````````````````
  Roll the die to determine how far you can move each turn. You manually stop
the die after starting it.


MOVING:
```````
  You can travel through London using the keys or joystick. Each round you roll
the die to see how many moves you can take.

  As you perambulate the fog-shrouded streets, the number of moves you make
registers on the lower left of the screen. If you make a wrong turn,
happen up a blind alley, or get too close to the chilly Thames, simply
retrace your steps. You can do this as long as you haven't moved the
total allotment of steps; in other words, if you rolled six and have only
gone five steps, you can double back. If you have gone six steps, however,
your position is locked in and your turn is over (the die also disappears).
Entering a location means you lose the rest of the moves available in this
turn, no matter how many there were left. In other words, entering a location
is the final movement of your turn.

  Whenever you enter a location, the computer counts that entrance as a "Clue
received." This effects your game Rating. For this reason, it is an extremely
good idea to pay attention when you approach a location. You may step into a
place you did not want to enter.


MAP SCREEN:
```````````
  When M is pressed, you are shown a top-down view of London, your position
given as a flashing square. The other players are also visible, appearing as
different colours on the Map with each person's initials shown:
IA - Irene Adler; LS - Inspector Lestrade; JW - Dr. John Watson; SH - Sherlock
Holmes. The Map may be viewed at any time during your turn. To exit, press any
key. S is a Secret Tunnel entrance, see the section further down for more
information. +++ is a graveyard which don the northern sections of the map. One
can not enter these, yet they do block your path.

GAME PLAY OBJECTIVE:
````````````````````
  Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, Irene Adler, and Inspector Lestrade must solve
thirty of the most difficult and intriguing cases to ever test their abilities.
Each sleuth thinks he or she is the most capable of finding the solutions, so
they've decided to turn each mystery into a friendly competition of their
skills.

  The famous four meet at 221B Baker Street, address of Holmes and Watson. From
there, they travel through the streets and alleys of London, gathering clues
and trying to outwit each other. The investigators use secret tunnels to gain
quick access to other parts of buildings where valuable evidence is contained.
Of course, locked-out sleuths can find keys at the Locksmith.

  The detectives are armed with secret codes, allowing them to receive
exclusive information from fifteen locations around the city. While working to
solve the crime, each sleuth is trying to break the other' codes in order to
have access to more clues with less work. They can alsochange their own codes
to throw the others off the track.

  The winner is the one who solves the mystery by returning to 221B Baker
Street with a badge and announcing the correct solution. Only the correct
answers will do, although there is no penalty for trying apart from wasting
your time and losing the badge.


BADGES:
```````
  Players receive detective badges at Scotland Yard. There are two uses for the
badges. For one, they lock locations, preventing opponents from just walking in
after you've acquired the valuable Clues you need. Blue badges mark which
locations have been locked. Only one badge can be carried at a time so return
to Scotland Yard if you need a new one. You may not lock three locations: 221B
Baker Street, Scotland Yard, or the Locksmith Shop. The second use for the
badge is to solve the crime back at 221B Baker Street. When giving the wrong
solution you also use up the badge and have to return to Scotland Yard once
more before trying the solution again.


KEYS:
`````
  Players start each game with one key. Keys are needed to unlock locations
which another player has locked with a badge. It is also used to enter Secret
Tunnels. Once a key is used, it is lost. You can get new ones from the
Locksmith Shop. Just like badges you can only possess one key at a time.


BUILDINGS, THE DOCK, & HYDE PARK:
`````````````````````````````````
  Crimson arrows mark the portals of several important locations. Upon
entering, you will be given a Clue!

  If you enter Hyde Park at one end, you will exit at the opposite end. If you
travel to the Park from the Carriage Depot, you will always leave the Park via
the lower exit.

  Once you enter a location and receive information, your turn is over. If you
had moves left on your roll of the Die, these are now gone.


CLUES:
``````
  Upon entering a location, you will receive a Clue. There are no clues to find
at 221B Baker St. If this is in code you have to decipher it first.

  Some Clues are in two or more parts (Motive Clues, Weapon Clues, etc.)
and you must piece these together as you progress from one place to the
next.


SECRET TUNNELS:
```````````````
  There are manhole covers found near the Locksmith Shop and Scotland Yard
leading down into "secret tunnels." Each of these peculiar paths whisks you to
one of seven random areas. The Locksmith Shop tunnel has one set of seven
routes; the Scotland Yard tunnel has a second set. They do not share the same
locations as their destination. 221B Baker St. is the only location without
secret tunnel access. You need to key to access the secret tunnel.

  Tunnels transport you into both unlocked and locked locations. Locked
locations remain locked when you leave though so you can simply walk back
inside after you have left.

  Another tunnel travel advantage is that you do not have to walk from one
place to another. The disadvantage is that you can never be sure where you are
going till you get there.


CARRIAGE DEPOT:
```````````````
  There are three things to do at the Carriage Depot. One is to hire a cab.
Choose one of the 14 specific location. The only restriction is if the place
you want to see is locked. Naturally, having a key will circumvent this
encumbrance.

  If you do not want to go racing over the city's colourful, cobbled roads,
you may ask for a clue like most places offer, or you can change your code. The
latter is done to throw off your opponent(s) trying to break your code.


STRATEGIES:
```````````
* While you do not have clues to think about, try to break the opponent's code.

* Use badges and keys wisely. Do not lock a location next to the locksmith if
  there are better alternatives.
  
* Jolt down your clues and keep a checklist of where you have been. Repeated
  visits not only count towards your rating but they also waste your time in
  the race to solve the crime.


SOLVING THE CASE:
`````````````````
  When you have gathered enough clues to solve the Case, the next step is
elementary; head straight away to 221B Baker St. Do not forget that you need a
badge solve the case. Once there, you're asked questions pertinent to the
mystery's resolution. If you solve the crime, you are hailed as the winner and
the entire scenario is revealed.

  If however, the wrong solution is given, you are forced to scurry back to
Scotland Yard for another badge before trying again, but you may also want to
collect some more clues first.


RATING SCREEN:
``````````````
  Once the crime is solved you receive a rating depending on how many clues it
it took. The fewer the clues, the higher the rating:
                        .;--------------------------;.

| CASE # 1: The Unholy Man |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   A strange preacher had come to town, a large morocco-bound Bible under    |
| his arm. Scotland Yard is puzzled when the preacher is found stabbed to     |
| death in his balcony seat at the Playhouse during a performance of Hamlet.  |
|   Duchess Tallcourt, who accompanied the victim to the Playhouse, dis-      |
| covered the body upon returning from the powder room after intermission.    |
| The preacher's Bible was gone; and on the floor neait)y were a German-made  |
| cigarette and a packet of aspirin.                                          |
|   It was common knowledge that the Duchess, previously a benefactor of the  |
| Bishop of Whittenfroth, had come to support the new preacher's views. This  |
| greatly angered the Bishop and Duke Tallcourt.                              |
|   The Longworth Acting Troupe was performing the play, Earl Longworth in    |
| the lead. Longworth, a rascally cad, had been wooing the Duchess's          |
| daughter, Anastasia, in hopes of gaining support for his poverty-stricken   |
| troupe.                                                                     |
|   Scotland Yard wants to know a) who killed the preacher, b) the weapon,    |
| and c) the motive.                                                          |

|   The preacher was in fact a thief who had stolen the original manuscript   |
| of Hamlet from an exhibit on the Riviera, where he also acquired his tan.   |
|   The preacher disguised the manuscript as a Bible and had Longworth        |
| authenticate it for the Duke, whom the preacher hoped would buy it.         |
| Longworth, however, in desperate need of money, killed the preacher with    |
| Hamlet's sword and stole the manuscript. Longworth, who does not smoke,     |
| planted the German-made cigarette near the victim's body to throw suspicion |
| from himself; but in the process, he accidentally dropped his packet of     |
| aspirin.                                                                    |

| CASE # 2: Silver Patch |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   Yesterday morning, the famous thoroughbred horse, Silver Patch, and his   |
| trainer, Oscar Switt, were found dead in the horse's stall at the Cosgrove  |
| Stables.                                                                    |
|   The horse had been poisoned; and the trainer had been hit over the head   |
| and stabbed repeatedly with a sharp object.                                 |
|   Silver Patch, so named for the patch of silver hair on his mane, was      |
| owned by Sir Reginald Cosgrove, a breeder who also owns four other horses.  |
|   Persons routinely questioned by Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard        |
| include Sir Reginald Cosgrove and his petite wife, Madame Hilda Cosgrove;   |
| the Cosgrove cook, Mrs. Maggie Doan; Mrs. Doan's husband, house painter     |
| Henry Doan; and rival horse breeder, Sir Archibald Baxter. Scotland Yard    |
| is also looking for one Bobby Jansen, a stable boy who left the Cosgrove's  |
| employ, unhappily, about a month ago.                                       |
|   The only clues discovered at the scene of the crime were some broken      |
| pieces of glass from the bottom of an ale bottle and a pawnbroker's ticket. |
|   Unable to develop a solid lead, Inspector Gregson has come to 221 B Baker |
| Street to consult with the master sleuth. Gregson wants to know a) who      |
| killed the horse and the trainer, b) the weapon used to kill the trainer,   |
| and c) the motive.                                                          |

|.............................................................................|
|   Sir Reginald Cosgrove, in dire need of money, concocted a plot to collect |
| money from his large insurance policy on Silver Patch.                      |
|   Sir Reginald painted over the silver patch on the mane of his prize horse |
| and painted a silver patch on the mane of Night Dancer, another of his      |
| horses. He then switched stalls and poisoned Night Dancer, who now looked   |
| like Silver Patch.                                                          |
|   Realizing that he would have to take Oscar Switt into his confidence, Sir |
| Reginald arranged for his trainer to meet him at the stables. When Switt    |
| refused to go along with Sir Reginald's plan to kill Night Dancer, Sir      |
| Reginald became enraged and killed the trainer, smashing him over the head  |
| with an ale bottle, then stabbing him repeatedly with the broken bottle.    |

| CASE # 3: The Chameleon's Vengeance |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   Byron Chivers, a boyhood friend of Sherlock Holmes, arrives from          |
| Switzerland with a fine Swiss pocket watch as a present for the famous      |
| sleuth.                                                                     |
|   Byron, Watson, and Holmes are about to leave for the Playhouse, where     |
| violin virtuoso Alfredo Fetuchinni is going to perform. It is well known    |
| that Holmes is a violin buff, so Playhouse director, Sir Charles            |
| Higginbottom, has asked Holmes to play a duet finale with Fetuchinni.       |
|   While Byron, Watson, and Holmes are waiting for their carriage,Inspector  |
| Lestrade rushes up with ominous news: The Chameleon, a master of disguise,  |
| has escaped prison. It was Holmes who originally captured the Chameleon,    |
| and the criminal swore vengeance on this, the first anniversary of his      |
| capture.                                                                    |
|   Fearing for his friend's life, Watson attempts to prevent Holmes from     |
| going to the concert. But the detective is adamant.                         |
|   At the Playhouse, Madam Clara Leslie, a wealthy patron of the arts,       |
| presents Holmes with a potted geranium. Carriage driver Jerome Magnuson     |
| tells the party he'll return to pick them up after the concert.             |
|   Watson attends to the WC and returns with a sudden case of laryngitis,    |
| blaming it on his nervousness concerning the Chameleon. Sir Charles         |
| Higgenbottom personally greets Holmes' party to show them to their balcony  |
| seats, and Holmes notices that Sir Charles is extraordinarily pale.         |
|   The Chameleon has indeed formulated a plot which involves a deathly       |
| surprise for the master detective. In order to abort the Chameleon's plan,  |
| Holmes must find out a) what the surprise is, b) where the surprise is      |
| hidden, and c) unmask the Chameleon.                                        |
|   The game is afoot!                                                        |

| CASE # 4: The Coded Message |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|  Last week the sad song of a hungry canary drew landlord Hilda Trevors to   |
| check the small room above the Pawnbroker shop, where she found the         |
| canary's owner and proprietor of the Pawnbroker shop, Rafer Harmon, dead of |
| a heart attack.                                                             |
|   Harmon was slumped over his Edwardian style desk, surrounded by a roomful |
| of assorted pawned items such as a riding saddle; a cobbler's bench; a      |
| complete set of Old English armour; a handmade wooden battleship; an old    |
| handcarved Hotel sign; a collection of Dutch pottery; and an array of       |
| musical instruments, clocks, and watches.                                   |
|   On the desk top next to Harmon was an envelope addressed to one Harry     |
| Blake, in care of a prison in Switzerland.                                  |
|   An investigation by Scotland Yard has revealed that Rafer Harmon was      |
| actually Rudolph Hickel, a petty thief wanted by authorities for his        |
| involvement in a number of burglary capers. Hickel dropped out of sight a   |
| few years ago after double-crossing a band of fellow thieves involved in a  |
| London Museum jewel heist.                                                  |
|   Hickel disappeared with the two most valuable items of the heist - the    |
| famous matching Eyes of Lucifer pearls, worth over fifty thousand pounds    |
| apiece. His partners, and Scotland Yard, have been searching for Hickel     |
| ever since.                                                                 |
|   The envelope on Hickel's desk contained a note, apparently written in     |
| code. Scotland Yard believes that Hickel knew he was dying and penned       |
| this note, intending to send it to his old friend Harry Blake, who is due   |
| to be released from prison in two weeks.                                    |
|   The coded note reads as follows:                                          |
|   XQZMZBDCHRMHRKQZDO                                                        |
|   Unable to crack the code, Scotland Yard has come to Sherlock Holmes for   |
| assistance. The Yard wants Holmes to a) translate the coded message.        |
|   Watson shakes his head in bewilderment as Holmes studies the message,     |
| takes a puff on his pipe, and remarks that this should be a rather          |
| elementary code to break.                                                   |

| ERIN was scrawled in blood on the cigar case above his body.                |
|   Gregson believes that if they can just find a woman named Erin who knew   |
| Maloney, they can solve the mystery. Gregson's assistant, however, has      |
| suggested that the word ERIN is a code word of the Erse Kernes, a secret    |
| revolutionary group active in Ireland during the country's last struggle    |
| with Britain; and he believes that Maloney's death was some sort of revenge |
| killing.                                                                    |
|   Gregson asks Holmes which of the two theories the Baker Street sleuth     |
| thinks correct, but Holmes expresses his wish to visit the scene of the     |
| crime before embracing any theories.                                        |
|   At the Tobacconist shop, Holmes notices that the area behind the counter  |
| is in disarray, as if someone had been frantically searching for something. |
| And above the back shelf, next to a photograph of Maloney himself smoking a |
| pipe, is a large hanging calendar. Penciled into the calendar block         |
| containing today's date are the initials "D.H." and the time "9:00 a.m."    |
|   "Did you find a weapon?" Watson asks the Scotland Yard detective.         |
|   "No," replies Gregson.                                                    |
|   "Do you have any witnesses or suspects?" asks Watson.                     |
|   "None," says Gregson. "The body was found this morning by carriage        |
| driver Daniel Hardy, who stopped in the shop to purchase some pipe          |
| tobacco."                                                                   |
|   "Indeed," remarks Inspector Cooke, "this is a very complex case. It seems |
| too much to hope that we will ever find the solution."                      |
|   "Not so, Inspector," offers a confident Holmes. "Quite often, the more    |
| complex a case appears on the surface, the simpler the actual solution."    |
|   Holmes assures them they will be able to discover a) who killed the       |
| tobacco clerk, b) the weapon, and c) the motive.                            |
|   The game is afoot!                                                        |

| CASE # 6: The Rewritten Death |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   The curtain rises on the third act of a Playhouse mystery, Sherlock       |
| Holmes and Dr. Watson attending the performance.                            |
|   Playhouse star Roderick Garrick, dashingly costumed in a crimson uniform, |
| acts to solve the puzzling death of a fellow officer.                       |
|   In the wings Vance Hillyard, Garrick's understudy, stands silently        |
| reflecting on each movement the noted Thespian makes. Playhouse owner Ogden |
| Bennett, fretting over declining ticket sales, paces nervously behind the   |
| scenery.                                                                    |
|   On stage, the lovely Regina Fulton, actress-wife of playwright Stephen    |
| Fulton, sobs under questioning. Albert Boswell, attired in a green          |
| officer's tunic to denote the Rifle Brigade, steps to her side.             |
|   In a stunning denouncement, Garrick reveals Boswell to be the murderer.   |
| Cornered, Boswell draws a revolver; the two men grapple. A shot rings out;  |
| a second shot ensues. Boswell recoils, falling lifelessly between the       |
| footlights.                                                                 |
|   Applause is short. Regina Fulton hysterically screams for a doctor.       |
| Albert Boswell has been murdered.                                           |
|   Roderick Garrick swears the second shot did not result from the staged    |
| fight; prop master Cliff Acker insists he loaded the gun with 'blanks'; and |
| play wright Stephen Fulton, discounting rumors of an affair between his     |
| wife and Boswell, vows the sole reason he wrote the confrontation scene,    |
| substituting a revolver for a knife, was in the interests of better drama.  |
|   Holmes must find out a) who killed the actor, and b) the motive.          |

| CASE # 7: The Pillaged Pawnbroker |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   Early this morning, Miles Balfour, the proprietor of the Pawnbroker shop, |
| was found stabbed to death behind the main counter of his establishment.    |
|   The lock on Balfour's front door had been broken and five pounds eleven   |
| shillings was missing from the Pawnbroker's cash till.                      |
|   A careful inventory, conducted by Scotland Yard, also revealed that the   |
| bizarre thief had absconded with the following items: yesterday's           |
| newspaper, a porcelain flower vase, a ball of string, and a helmet which    |
| was unbolted from a complete set of Old English armour.                     |
|   Mrs. Eunice Balfour, who discovered her husband's body, is at a loss to   |
| shed further light on the tragedy. She recalls that her husband, who had    |
| recently purchased the shop from Alistair Krebs, had only bitter words for  |
| his unprofitable investment.                                                |
|   Indeed, Mrs. Balfour could remember only three customers during the       |
| entire week: newspaper reporter Henry Kirk, who paid in coin to redeem some |
| books; Mrs. Phyllis Cahill, who cleaned out her husband John's attic; and   |
| Playhouse manager Wilbur Partridge, who pawned a dusty prop box for which   |
| he couldn't find a key.                                                     |
|   Scotland Yard theorizes Balfour happened to surprise a thief burgling the |
| shop during the night and they have arrested Paulie "The Pick" Chandler, a  |
| petty crook who was seen in the area.                                       |
|   Informed of the facts in the case, Sherlock Holmes is convinced a thread  |
| of deeper logic runs throughout the extraordinary affair and that Scotland  |
| Yard has yet to find a) the killer, b) the weapon, and c) the motive.       |
|   The game is afoot!                                                        |

| CASE # 8: The Empty-Handed Thief |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   Yesterday evening, the shiftless owner of the Boar's Head Inn, Jerome     |
| Galton, was found murdered in his study above the Pub.                      |
|   Mrs. Bernice Galton, the deceased's rather plain wife, stated she left    |
| the upstairs flat hurriedly around 5:30 p.m. to pay an overdue grocer's     |
| bill. After dining with her father, Lord Renshaw, at the Hotel, Mrs. Galton |
| returned at 8 p.m. to find her husband lying on the floor amid scattered    |
| papers, broken glass, and several overturned chairs. The pub keeper had     |
| been stabbed repeatedly in the chest.                                       |
|   The door of Galton's wall safe was open, and a box containing the Renshaw |
| diamonds, bequeathed to Beatrice by her late mother. Lady Renshaw, was      |
| missing.                                                                    |
|   Miss Cynthia Dale, the comely waitress at the grogshop, remembered Galton |
| had seemed fretful earlier that afternoon when he had received in the mail  |
| an inordinate amount of correspondence, and, grumbling, retired to his      |
| study to open the letters.                                                  |
|   Police constables learned tobacconist Zachary Burke had engaged Galton in |
| a heated quarrel on the day of the murder. But both Burke and Lord Renshaw  |
| proved most uncooperative under questioning.                                |
|   However, the most startling development of the case occurred this morn-   |
| ing, when a royal European family informed authorities that they had        |
| secretly purchased the Renshaw diamonds from Galton two years ago.          |
|   Scotland Yard wants to know a) who killed the pub owner, b) the weapon,   |
| and c) the motive.                                                          |

|   As was her custom periodically, Mrs. Beatrice Galton opened the wall safe |

| floor and she whirled, stepping firmly, only to find the "diamond" crushed  |
| underfoot. Numbly, Beatrice smashed "jewel" after "jewel" with a letter     |
| opener from the desk. She suddenly realized the truth.  Her husband had     |
| disposed of her diamonds, replaced the gems with glass replicas, and        |
| squandered the money. Beatrice confronted Galton as he entered the room     |
| with the latest packet of unpaid bills and, in a fury, she stabbed him.     |

| CASE # 9: The Peculiar Charwoman |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|  Last week the body of a young charwoman was found in the storeroom of the  |
| Tobacconist. Tobacco dealer Daniel Ferguson, who discovered the dead girl,  |
| has identified the victim as Bessie Kidder, a new employee of the firm.     |
|   Mrs. Louise Ferguson, the tobacco dealer's wife, rather callously         |
| remarked that her husband probably worked the poor girl to death.           |
|   Indeed, all evidence suggests the victim did expire from the rigors of    |
| her job or, at least, by natural causes. No marks were found on the body    |
| and a coroner's report indicates no trace of poison.                        |
|   Persons routinely questioned by Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard       |
| include Lowell Quilley, a clerk who insists he never met the unfortunate    |
| girl; Ralph Pennman, a delivery man who refuses to answer any questions     |
| without the presence of a solicitor; and Daniel Ferguson, who claims the    |
| investigation has upset his delicate schedule of weekly commuting to his    |
| Liverpool shop.                                                             |
|   Inspector Lestrade would readily close the case were it not for one       |
| disturbing piece of evidence: Bessie Kidder apparently reported for work    |
| with painted fingernails.                                                   |
|   Holmes must find out a) who killed the charwoman, b) the motive, and c)   |

| CASE #10: The Duchess's Demise |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   The kindly Duchess of Barrington was found murdered this after noon in    |
| her sitting room at Barrington Manor. She had been brutally struck over the |
| head with a fireplace poker.                                                |
|   Scotland Yard has learned from the housemaid, Mrs. Maggie Wyatt, that a   |
| bridge party was in progress during the time of the murder.                 |
|   The Duchess, an expert player, would but watch, seemingly content to      |
| enjoy having company in her lonely estate.                                  |
|   The players included Lucy Blackthorn, the Duchess's niece; Colin Rodney,  |
| Lucy's suitor; Alex Stafford, a retired music hall performer; and Vera      |
| Bigelow, a charming young woman of obscure origins.                         |
|   Mrs. Wyatt stated that Rodney, goaded into a foul mood by his continual   |
| losses, frequently snapped at the Duchess, and did his chances of obtaining |
| the Duchess's consent to Lucy's marriage great harm.                        |
|   Appearing considerably ruffled, the Duchess excused herself and retired   |
| to her sitting room. She asked that each player might visit her, when, as   |
| dummy, they would take no active part in the play of a hand.                |
|   After Rodney's visit, the Duchess called down, inviting Stafford to come  |
| up when he could.                                                           |
|   As Stafford left the sitting room, the players heard the Duchess call     |
| through the door in a shrill and somewhat strained voice, "You'll help me,  |
| won't you, Alex?" to which Stafford nodded in reply.                        |
|   Those words were the last the guests of Barrington Manor ever heard the   |
| Duchess speak. From that moment, the players were never out of sight of     |
| each other; the Duchess's sitting room was in plain sight of the card       |
| parlor; yet, someone, somehow, had managed to commit murder.                |
|   Scotland Yard wants Holmes to uncover a) who killed the Duchess, b) the   |
| motive, and c) how the killer's alibi was established.                      |
|   The game is afoot!                                                        |

| CASE #11: The Deadly Caller |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|  The annual Lyons family reunion at the Hotel has been postponed            |
| indefinitely. This morning, the wealthy matriarch of the clan, Mrs.         |
| Griselda Lyons, was found poisoned in her Hotel room.                       |
|   The windows and the door were all still locked from the inside and        |
| nothing eatable or drinkable was found in the victim's room.                |
|   Hotel manager Giles Hagedorn, who was drawn to the room by a complaint    |
| from a guest overhearing a whistling radiator, states Mrs. Lyons was able   |
| to gasp three words before she expired: "I called him."                     |
|   Scotland Yard has arrested Hotel bellhop Bruce Sinclair and is holding    |
| him for the murder of the guest.                                            |
|   Sinclair swears he is innocent, but admits he answered a call by Mrs.     |
| Lyons during the night to open a heating ventilator near the woman's bed.   |
|   According to Mrs. Lyons' stepson, Captain Victor Juno, recently returned  |
| from duty in India, the family took adjoining suites at the Hotel and spent |
| the afternoon on a picnic in the Park where a quarrel ensued.               |
|   Against her mother's wishes, Priscilla Lyons had invited Homer Mayhew,    |
| a Bank teller who had continuously courted Priscilla during her stay in     |
| London.                                                                     |
|   Late in the evening, the family adjourned to the Pub, where Mrs. Lyons    |
| introduced her fiance, Lorenzo Marchetti, a flamboyant young man many       |
| years her junior.                                                           |
|   To prove Sinclair's innocence, Holmes must unmask a) the killer, b) the   |

|.............................................................................|
|   Captain Victor Juno feared his stepmother's wild infatuation for gigolo   |
| Lorenzo Marchetti and concocted a fiendish murder plot to secure his        |
| inheritance. Juno returned to England carrying a deadly but trained Indian  |
| cobra. He then adjusted the radiator in his stepmother's room to emit a     |
| "whistling" pitch. From his adjoining room, Juno released the cobra into a  |
| common ventilator shaft opening near his stepmother's bed. As Mrs. Lyons    |
| rose in the night hearing the gentle sound of movement, she realized too    |
| late that "music" from the radiator pipes had "charmed" the caller.         |

| CASE #12: The Spinster's Will |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   Wealthy spinster Miss Murgatroyd Pierpoint has died in her sleep. The     |
| deceased, found in the bedroom of her townhouse near the Park, had on her   |
| nightstand an unread newspaper, a packet of aspirin, and a bottle of        |
| brandy, which Miss Pierpoint claimed to have used for medicinal purposes.   |
|   A reading of the elderly lady's will was conducted this morning.          |
|   To her niece, Miss Florence Catlett, Miss Pierpoint bequeathed the sum of |
| five thousand pounds, with the sole condition that the money would be       |
| forfeit if her niece married within five years.                             |
|   The proviso drew an outburst from Miss Catlett's fiance, Elmo Wadsworth,  |
| a stevedore at the Dock.                                                    |
|   Housemaid Daphne Farber was remembered with a trust paying two thousand   |
| pounds a year. The trust was to be continued as long as the maid cared for  |
| Miss Pierpoint's poodle, 'Flopsy.                                           |
|   To druggist Ward Ramsey, Miss Pierpoint facetiously bequeathed a played   |
| out gold mine, which she claimed was as worthless as Ramsey's promises to   |
| marry her had been.                                                         |
|   The druggist took his misfortune in good humor, staling that the spinster |
| had, over the years, relished informing him of her vindictive provision.    |
|   The remainder of Miss Pierpoint's estate was to revert to Lawyer Meredith |
| Ballard, who the increasingly nearsighted spinster had come to rely on to   |
| transact her affairs.                                                       |
|   Dr. Watson, who examined the spinster only last week and found her in     |
| excellent health, suspects foul play. Holmes must find out a) who killed    |
| the spinster, b) the weapon, and c) the motive.                             |
|   The game is afoot!                                                        |

|   Among the suspects routinely questioned by Scotland Yard were Penelope    |
| Holloway, a seamstress who was preparing Miss Boylan's bridal trousseau;    |
| newspaper reporter Matthew Pratt, a powerful society columnist; Curt        |
| Rhodes, the deceased's cousin; and the Squire of Warwick.                   |
|   Each was rumored to have drawn Miss Boylan's wrath during the course of   |
| the week. Penelope Holloway had infuriated the bride-to-be with dressmaking |

| CASE #14: The Amorous Sailor |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
| FROM THE JOURNAL OF DR. WATSON:                                             |
|   When I received the telegram from Singapore, I was stunned to learn that  |
| Willie Dryden, a philandering merchant seaman friend of mine, was planning  |
| marriage.                                                                   |
|   His plan was to wed London pub waitress Mitzi Cornwallis on his next stop |
| in port and he wanted me to be his best man.                                |
|   A week later the wedding took place in the Hotel ballroom and Holmes      |
| accompanied me. Mitzi's father and mother, Nils and Clovis Cornwallis,      |
| seemed anxious to give the bride away, and the wedding came off, if you'll  |
| excuse the expression, without a hitch. Desiring to kiss the bride, I took  |
| my place in the receiving line behind a veiled lady in black. I kissed and  |
| chatted with Mitzi, then moved to shake hands with Willie. My old friend    |
| looked at me with a puzzled expression, his hand to his mouth, and fell     |
| over dead.                                                                  |
|   Holmes apprehended the lady in black as she was running out a side door.  |
| We removed her veil to discover she was Oriental. Though questioned         |
| intensely by Inspector Gregson, the woman would not utter a word.           |
|   Holmes simply looked at poor Willie Dryden's left hand and announced he   |

|   "I wed two wives" should be Willie Dryden's epitaph. The white ring of    |
| untanned flesh around Willie's ring finger tipped Holmes to the fact that   |
| Willie had no business marrying Mitzi. He was already married in Singapore  |
| to the lady in black. This femme fatale followed Willie to London, learned  |
| he was marrying Mitzi, took her place in the receiving line and gave Willie |
| the kiss of death.                                                          |

| CASE #15: The Unknown Victim |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   Holmes and Watson are among those attending a party given by Sir Barry    |
| Auguston and his wife Claudia. Others in attendance include Mr. and Mrs.    |
| Jeffry Riverside, good friends of the Augustons; the Rev. Allen J. Lakely;  |
| Elliot Maylard, an actor currently appearing at the Playhouse; and          |
| Priscilla Ellington, the famous authoress.                                  |
|   The guest of honor, General Carl Seagram, arrived in full military        |
| regalia, complete with a sword at his side.                                 |
|   The evening went well until half past ten, when a scream was heard from   |
| the upstairs level of the house. Several people, including Holmes, Watson,  |
| and Auguston, ran to see what was wrong.                                    |
|   They found the maid who had screamed, standing in the doorway of a        |
| bedroom used by the Augustons as a guest chamber. On the bed lay a dead man |
| who had been stabbed in the heart. A bloody sword, found next to the body,  |
| was immediately recognized as that of Gen. Carl Seagram. When the General   |
| was called for, he could not be found anywhere on the grounds.              |
|   Inspector Lestrade, who arrived with several officers shortly thereafter, |
| established one puzzling fact: no one present had ever seen the dead man    |
| before.                                                                     |
|   "Obviously, the General killed this man, then fled the premises,"         |
| concludes Lestrade. "Although I've no idea what the motive could be, or     |
| who this fellow is, once we find the General, we'll have the answers."      |
|   "I'm not so sure," replies Holmes. "I think that after some               |
| investigation, we'll find that the General is not our man."                 |
|   Holmes plans to find a) the real murderer, b) the identity of the victim, |
| and c) the motive.                                                          |

| CASE #16: The Kidnapped Songstress |

| FROM THE JOURNAL OF DR. WATSON:                                             |
|   Holmes and I had long looked forward to seeing American songstress        |
| Winnie Oats at the Playhouse. London was shocked, however, when the         |
| "Songbird of Cincinnati" was swept off the stage by a masked kidnapper who  |
| swung down from the rafters on a rope.                                      |
|   Playhouse director Barney Loss has hired Holmes to find his imported      |
| star. During the course of his investigation, the super sleuth questioned   |
| Winnie's husband, Guy Oats; her manager, Dale Rice; and Mrs. Oats'          |
| understudy, April Buns.                                                     |
|   The mask used by the kidnapper was found in the back of a carriage used   |
| by American newspaperman, Lloyd Newcomb, to race from the pub to Scotland   |
| Yard, gathering information for his story. Newcomb seemed extremely         |
| knowledgeable about Winnie Oats' career, so Inspector Gregson searched the  |
| newspaperman's hotel room and found programs from each of Winnie Oats'      |
| performances for the last three years.                                      |
|   Gregson also discovered that Winnie's husband, Guy, had booked passage    |
| for one person on a steamship leaving London. The reservation had been made |
| before the kidnapping.                                                      |
|   Winnie's manager, Dale Rice, said that Winnie and her husband had a       |
| fierce argument before the performance, but that Winnie would not tell her  |
| manager what the argument was about. Holmes' client, Barney Loss, wants     |
| London's greatest detective to find a) the kidnapper, b) the motive, and c) |
| the location of the kidnapped songbird.                                     |
|   The game is afoot!                                                        |

| dealer; Ralph Cotson, a jeweler; George Hemstud, a sea captain; Robert      |
| Hutboy, a tailor; Wilson Peterson, an inventor.                             |
|   Another player, Roger Stearns, fell over dead last week during one of the |
| club's regular games. At first, Stearns' death was thought to be the result |
| of a heart attack. But a subsequent autopsy revealed that Stearns died of   |
| cyanide poisoning.                                                          |
|   Scotland Yard suspects foul play, but is at a loss to determine a) the    |
| murderer, b) the motive, and c) how the poison was administered.            |

| CASE #18: The Gluttonous Gossip |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   Society page editor, Charles Maxwell, thought of himself as a brilliant   |
| journalist.  However, most people regarded him only as a malicious gossip.  |
|   Last week, Maxwell was finishing his fourth serving of fish and chips at  |
| the Pub when he collapsed. Three waiters carried the obese newspaperman to  |
| a large food delivery carriage parked outside the Pub and rushed him on his |
| way to London Emergency Hospital. Alas, poor Maxwell was dead on arrival.   |
|   The ever suspicious Bernard Quigley, claims manager of Thames Life        |
| Insurance Company, learned from the autopsy that significant traces of lead |
| were in Maxwell's blood. Quigley believes Maxwell was poisoned and refuses  |
| to pay any insurance claims until the murder is solved.                     |
|   The lamenting widow, Valerie Maxwell, now comes to 221 B Baker Street for |
| help. She wants to be paid the insurance proceeds. Valerie tells Holmes     |
| that Maxwell's younger brother, Ivar, an assistant at the Apothecary, was   |
| the only other beneficiary.                                                 |
|   Valerie tells Holmes and Watson that Maxwell's enemies were many. Banker  |
| Ian Rutledge has thrice sued Maxwell for libel. Only last week, Tobacconist |
| Arnold Hawke publicly rebuked Maxwell as a "liar." Rumor has it that        |
| Maxwell was also soundly publicly thrashed recently by Hotel Manager Fred   |
| Thrush for implying that Thrush's wife, Helen, was having an affair with    |
| "the milkman" named Harold Quail.                                           |
|   Holmes declares that a murder has occurred. He must discover a) the       |
| killer, b) the motive, and c) the manner in which the murder was accomp-    |
| lished.                                                                     |

| CASE #19: The Well-Informed Thief |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   Joan Haigh is a cheerful widow living in a small flat in Newchester       |
| Downs. Last week, she was the victim of a theft that wiped out her entire   |
| life savings.                                                               |
|   Penniless, Mrs. Haigh comes to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to restore  |
| her loss. She tells Holmes that the theft occurred between 3:30 p.m. and    |
| 4:00 p.m. last Monday when she was strolling in the Park. "I take my walk   |
| every day at precisely that time, Mr. Holmes."                              |
|   "Was there anything odd about this theft?" inquired Watson.               |
|   "Oh, my dear yes!" exclaimed Mrs. Haigh. "The thief knew exactly where to |
| look. He found my diamonds hidden in a brick in the fireplace and my entire |
| gold coin collection concealed in the ceiling. Somehow he even knew to take |
| my tattered bath mat, which had twenty pound notes sewn inside. Nothing     |
| else in the house was disturbed."                                           |
|   "Who knew of your possessions?" asked Holmes.                             |
|   "Absolutely no one could know," replied the widow. "I carefully hid my    |
| valuables long ago and never told a soul."                                  |
|   Mrs. Haigh tells Holmes that she never has visitors to her modest home,   |
| save for her dockworker nephew, Rance, and her neighbors Alice and Ridley   |
| Cranapple. Ridley is a pawnbroker.                                          |
|   In the week preceding the theft, Mrs. Haigh visited the church and passed |
| a donation to Reverend Smith; had a tooth extracted by dentist Harrison     |
| Beale; and purchased food at Oscar Kruger's market.                         |
|   Holmes must discover a) who stole Mrs. Haigh's life savings and b) how    |
| the thief knew where to look.                                               |

| Clarence Alexander discovered that Pupil had filed false income tax returns |

| CASE #21: The Fallen Angel |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
| FROM THE JOURNAL OF DR. WATSON:
|   Early this morning, the Royal Guard discovered human fly, Hector Angel,   |
| clutching a foot-long section of rope, at the base of the Tower of London.  |
| He had apparently fallen to his death from a ledge at the very top of the   |
| legendary Tower.                                                            |
|   Moments later, the Royal Guard made a more startling discovery: The Crown |
| Jewels, stored in a chamber atop the Tower of London, had disappeared.      |
|   Within minutes, a loud rap on the door of 221 B Baker Street announced    |
| the arrival of a Scotland Yard carriage for the master sleuth. Inspector    |
| Lestrade presented my friend with an urgent letter from the Queen imploring |
| Holmes to recover the missing gems.                                         |
|   Upon arrival at the Tower, Holmes observed 1 ) Hector Angel entered the   |
| Tower from the outside through a vent at the very top, 2) the only rope     |
| found at the Tower was the piece Hector was clutching as he fell to his     |
| death, and 3) Hector was murdered by an accomplice to the jewel theft.      |
|   Holmes must discover a) who kilted Hector Angel, b) the murder weapon,    |
| and c) how the killer escaped from the scene of the crime.                  |
|   The game is afoot!                                                        |

| CASE #22: The Alphabet Spy |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
| FROM THE JOURNAL OF DR. WATSON:                                             |
|   We'd all thought Secret Service agent Throwbush had been killed in The    |
| Adventure of the Mystery Man, but he resurfaced to draw Holmes and I into   |
| another case of international intrigue. It was five years after America's   |
| Civil War, when agent Throwbush appeared and asked us to observe the        |
| patrons of the Boar's Head Inn, where a known foreign agent was working as  |
| a cook. The cook was expected to pass an important message to a second      |
| agent that very night. Unfortunately, the Secret Service didn't know who    |
| the second agent was or how the message would be passed. Therefore, they    |
| were compelled to call upon the keen eye of Sherlock Holmes.                |
|   We were just finishing our entree and looking forward to dessert, when    |
| Holmes leapt across the dining room to keep the second agent from eating    |
| the message planted in his alphabet soup by the cook. Holmes was certain    |
| the message was a date written out, but we had to unscramble the following  |
| sixteen alphabet noodles:                                                   |
|   TTTEEENNN                                                                 |
|    UUHAIGS                                                                  |
| "These letters form two words," Holmes explained, "the name of a month and  |
| the day within that month, spelled out. There are two letters among the     |
| sixteen that do not appear in the spelling of ANY day of the month, so they |
| must be in the NAME of the month."                                          |
|  Armed with this insight, Holmes went on to solve a) the message, b) what   |
| event the date refers to, and c) who sent the message.                      |
|   The game is afoot!                                                        |

| CASE #23: The Mysterious Skull |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
| FROM THE JOURNAL OF DR. WATSON:                                             |
|   London was a beehive of activity as we hosted the IV Olympic Games in the |
| summer of 1908. Holmes preferred the track and field events to the water    |
| sports, so we were contented to sit in the Olympic Stadium, until Lestrade  |
| showed up.                                                                  |
|   Evidently, the coach of the American water polo team was found floating   |
| in the Henley Regatta lanes marked off in the Thames. He was mortally       |
| injured by a skull fracture. As the coach expired, Horatio Hornblown and    |
| Fred Farent, the fishermen who dragged him from the river, heard him        |
| whisper,                                                                    |
| "The skull! The skull!"                                                     |
|   On the victim's body was a ticket to "Hamlet," five locker keys and,      |
| oddly enough, a pass from Scotland Yard. Lestrade explained that the coach  |
| was on the Olympic Rules Committee and often sat at the window of Chief     |

| CASE #24: The Musical Murder |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   Pianist William Minor and his string quartet were the rage of London, so  |
| Holmes and Watson got front row seats. Right in the middle of his finale, a |
| new composition entitled "Goodbye, Dolly", William was struck dead by an    |
| arrow through the heart. Scotland Yard immediately sealed off the Play-     |
| house. The Yard questioned each remaining member of the string quartet:     |
| cellist Beatrice Flatty, harpist Jeffery DeSharpe, and violinist Heide      |
| Minor, William's wife of many years. Playhouse owner, Major G.F. Keys, and  |
| concert promoter, Octavia Scales, were also questioned.                     |
|   Lestrade was scratching his head as he approached Holmes' front row seat. |
| "We found the arrow easily enough," the Scotland Yard inspector whined.     |
| "But we can't seem to find a bloody bow anywhere!"                          |
|   "If you can't find a bow at a string concert," Holmes returned im-        |
| patiently, "you are looking without seeing!"                                |
|   Holmes went on to note that, as William Minor was dying, he hammered      |
| three notes on the bloody keyboard. Holmes, a musician himself, recognized  |
| the notes as a natural G and a natural F followed by an E-flat. Holmes      |
| helped out the Yard, again, by disclosing a) the killer, b) the motive, and |
| c) the weapon.                                                              |

| CASE #25: The Eye of the Eiger |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
| FROM THE JOURNAL OF DR. WATSON:                                             |
|   How the mighty fall! I have always regarded the legendary mountaineer,    |
| Sir Edmund Hillman, with the utmost esteem. Now the great man sits before   |
| Holmes and me in ruins. This conqueror of the treacherous south face of the |
| Eiger mountain has been arrested for shoplifting at Eiger Fashions, a local |
| sports furbishing shop.                                                     |
|   "I am guilty, Mr. Holmes. There can be no doubt about that. I stuffed the |
| pair of boxer underwear into my coat pocket right in front of the           |
| shopkeeper. I can't say why I did it. I have never stolen anything before   |
| in my life. Besides, I detest boxer shorts. As a sportsman, I only wear     |
| jockey underwear."                                                          |
|   Holmes clearly took pity on the man's abject tale; particularly when Sir  |
| Edmund observed that, before the theft, he had been offered a lucrative     |
| contract to endorse a new line of Hawaiian sportswear to be introduced by   |
| Eiger Fashions under the name of "Lei Gear." Since the arrest, the owners   |
| of Eiger Fashions, Eileen and Gerald Mulch, have withdrawn the offer.       |
|   Perhaps Holmes was only trying to distact the old chap from his woes,     |
| but I was quite surprised when he gave Sir Edmund a pad of paper and a set  |
| of colored inks and invited him to doodle while recounting the famous Eiger |
| expedition. The modest Sir Edmund spoke mainly with praise of the men who   |
| climbed with him: Edmund Infall Germain, a Swiss diplomat; Regie Jackson, a |
| stockbroker; Dr. Simon Klopps, a psychologist; and Gerald Mulch of Eiger    |
| Fashions.                                                                   |
|   Just as Sir Edmund approached the most thrilling part of his tale, Holmes |
| interrupted and asked to look at the mountaineer's scribbles.               |
|   "It worked," Holmes muttered. Then pointing to what Sir Edmund had        |
| absentmindedly sketched, the great detective proclaimed that he would       |
| prove Sir Edmund innocent of any wrongdoing. "A man cannot be found         |
| guilty unless he is shown to possess mens rea or guilty purpose for his     |
| acts. You, Sir Edmund, are completely innocent."                            |
|   I examined the scribbles to see what led Holmes to such an extraordinary  |
| conclusion. After all, Sir Edmund had confessed his guilt.                  |
|   The scribbles only consisted of a sketch of the Eiger mountain with what  |
| resembled a green eye at the summit.                                        |
|   "What does this show, Holmes?"                                            |
|   The master detective replied, "It merely identifies a) the criminal       |
| responsible for Sir Edmund's plight, b) his motive, and c) the method of    |
| his crime."                                                                 |

| to shoplift clothes bearing the Eiger Fashions logo. Holmes realized that   |
| Sir Edmund's doodles of a green eye in the Eiger revealed the solution to   |
| the case. Sir Edmund's subconscious mind associated Dr. Klopps with the     |
| one-eyed monster of myth, the cyclops. The green eye on the sketch          |
| suggested envy as a motive and hypnotism as the means of the crime.         |

| CASE #26: The Random Murders |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   Scotland Yard is bewildered by a recent spate of murders in the           |
| fashionable seaside community of Eastbourne. In the past two weeks, 47      |
| citizens have been murdered by gunshot. All victims were shot in the head   |
| while standing in the doorway to their homes. Inspector Lestrade has been   |
| unable to find any motive for the killings. The victims do not appear to be |
| related. In no case was there evidence of robbery or even a struggle.       |
|   As the death toll mounted, Inspector Lestrade felt he had no choice but   |
| to consult the master detective to solve the riddle of the random murders:  |
| "Please help, Mr. Holmes. Commissioner Harry Mugg has told me that if I     |
| don't solve this crime wave soon, I will be reassigned to the traffic       |
| division. And you know there are only four motor vehicles in all of         |
| England!"                                                                   |
|   In order to assist Holmes, Lestrade has drawn up a list of suspects:      |
| Satanist Alistair Mallory; escaped mass murderer Henry Hyde; Irish revolu-  |
| tionary Brendan Bee; anarchist Caesar Grasshopper; and the archvillianous   |
| duo of Professor James Moriarty and Colonel Sebastian Moran.                |
|   To Lestrade's grave disappointment, Holmes declined the assignment due to |
| the crush of prior commitments. When word of the master detective's refusal |
| circulated, Sherlock Holmes was served with a subpoena to appear before the |
| Select Parliamentary Committee on Law and Order. When the committee         |
| chairman. Sir Leroy Tick (M.P., Eastbourne) challenged Sherlock Holmes in   |
| public session to solve the mass murders, the incomparable detective        |
| stunned the audience by identifying a) the killer, b) the mastermind, and   |
| c) the motive for the murders.                                              |
|   The game is afoot!                                                        |

| number of Labour votes but also provided him with a strong "Law and Order"  |

| he set the shocking events in motion by ordering his unbalanced aide to "do |
| what it takes" to eliminate the Labour lead in the polls. Byron did as he   |

| CASE #27: Moriarty's Challenge |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
| FROM THE JOURNAL OF DR. WATSON:                                             |
|   I can assure you, dear reader, that during my tour of duty in India in    |
| the service of Her Majesty's Imperial Army, there were many instances when  |
| I found myself in the gravest peril. Yet at no time in my entire life have  |
| I been more fearful for my continued existence than I was last night.       |
|   It all began when Holmes and I received an invitation from Sherlock's     |
| brother, Mycroft, to dine at 8:00 p.m. at the posh London Bistro restaurant |
| on the occasion of Sherlock's birthday. The telegram of invitation spoke of |
| a "celebration of an important milestone in Sherlock's life."               |
|   To our great disappointment, Mycroft did not appear and Sherlock began to |
| suspect that he was the victim of a hoax. This suspicion was confirmed when |
| he opened his menu and in the candlelight of the elegant restaurant read    |
| the following message:                                                      |
|      "Welcome, Mr. Holmes. I have a very special birthday                   |
|      celebration in mind for you, that is, if you have the                  |
|      courage to stay for the evening's entertainment. On                    |
|      the other hand, you are free to leave if you don't wish                |
|      to make this meal your last. The choice is yours. Bon                  |
|      Appetit!"                                                              |
|         Prof. James Moriarty                                                |

|   To my astonishment, my companion elected to stay. "I cannot permit        |
| Moriarty the satisfaction of watching me run and cower in fear. No, Watson, |
| we are going to stay put, enjoy our dinner, and foil any attempts to spoil  |
| the evening. Besides, I want to hear famed violinist Sol Ox perform at      |
| 10:00."                                                                     |
|   Neither the waiter, Bill Beaconfield, nor Maitre D', Henri Wickhill, can  |
| tell how Moriarty's message got in Holmes' menu. Chef George Torchwell and  |
| assistant Ida Matchbush both assure Holmes that no one has or will be       |
| permitted to tamper with the food.                                          |
|   Looking about the room, Holmes and Watson recognize only two other        |
| diners: Barrister Randy Lamptree and his ladyfriend, chemist Stella Plow.   |
|   I held my breath until Holmes averted disaster by identifying a) the      |
| person Moriarty selected to kill him, b) the intended murder method, and c) |
| the time the murder was to occur.                                           |

| CASE #28: The Doctor's Last Lament |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
| FROM THE JOURNAL OF DR. WATSON:                                             |
|   As a physician, I am of course saddened by the passing of a fellow        |
| practitioner of the medical arts, particularly when it is by his own hand.  |
|   Such was the sad story of a veteran of the South African Campaign, Dr.    |
| Vincent Van Nogh. Moved as I was by an account of his self-inflicted death  |
| in the London Times, I quoted aloud the good doctor's suicide note:         |
|   Dear Constable:                                                           |
|   I am frightfully weary with life in general. I fear I've been a bloody    |
|   bore. It is a relief at long last to say adieu.                           |
|      Vincent                                                                |
|                                                                             |
|   The newspaper account went on to note that Dr. Van Nogh poisoned himself  |
| with cyanide, which was found in his mouth.                                 |
|   The report concluded by identifying Van Nogh's pallbearers: Thomas        |
| Renova, Waldo Barrett, Gen. Vernon Arnoux, and Reginald Burnham.            |
|   To my astonishment, Holmes replied to my recital that, clearly, Dr. Van   |
| Nogh had been murdered and that my sadness for his passing could best be    |
| expiated by bringing the killer to justice.                                 |
|   Before I could protest that perhaps this time his imagination had the     |
| best of him, Holmes summoned: "Come, Watson, get your coat, for we must     |
| identify a) the killer, b) the weapon, and c) the motive."                  |
|   The game is afoot!                                                        |

|   Dr. Van Nogh was a man with a guilty conscience. He served in the British |
| Army during the South African campaign; but when he was captured in battle  |
| he became a traitor and fought on the side of the Boers. Hence his cryptic  |
| remark that he had been a "bloody bore". His commanding officer, General    |
| Vernon Arnoux, always suspected Van Nogh's treason but could never prove    |
| it. Finally, he decided to take justice into his own hands and "execute"    |
| Van Nogh. When Arnoux confronted Van Nogh, he permitted the doctor to write |
| a suicide note. The General killed Van Nogh by injecting air into the man's |
| arm with a hypodermic needle. Afterwards, thinking that he needed a more    |
| credible suicide method, General Arnoux poured cyanide into the dead man's  |
| mouth.                                                                      |

| CASE #29: The Mysterious Murder |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   Irene Marlow, wife of the wealthy Colonel John Marlow, has come to 221 B  |
| Baker Street with an urgent request. Colonel Marlow was found floating dead |
| in the Thames River a week ago. There were no outwardsigns of any cause of  |
| death, so Scotland Yard concluded that Colonel Marlow had drowned. But      |
| knowing that the Colonel was a good swimmer, Mrs. Marlow suspects foul      |
| play.                                                                       |
|   However, Mrs. Marlow hasn't the slightest idea why anyone would want the  |
| Colonel murdered. She is only able to give a few facts regarding the night  |
| of Marlow's death. The Colonel went to visit a friend, Sir Arthur Pendle-   |
| ton, who was staying at the Hotel. Pendleton told the authorities that      |
| Marlow left the Hotel at 9:00 p.m., alone. When Marlow's body was           |
| recovered, the only thing the authorities noted was that a button was       |
| missing from the Colonel's shirt.                                           |
|   Mrs. Marlow also gives the following information. Colonel Marlow's        |
| favorite nightspots were the Playhouse and the Pub. The two men he          |
| associated with the most were Sir Arthur Pendleton and Mr. Harold Poundley. |
| Finally, before the Colonel was married, he had had an affair with Harold   |

|   Irene Marlow was unaware of her husband's old business partnership with   |
| Albert Kenilworth. Colonel Marlow had swindled Kenilworth, driving him to   |
| commit suicide. Ten years later, Albert's brother Arnold made good on his   |
| threat of revenge. Marlow had never met Arnold Kenilworth, which Kenilworth |
| used to his advantage. He followed Marlow and engaged the unsuspecting      |
| Colonel in a game of backgammon at the Pub. After the game, Kenilworth      |
| lured Marlow to the Park, where he jumped the Colonel and injected him with |
| a large dose of strychnine, causing near-instantaneous death. Kenilworth    |
| then dragged Marlow's body to the Dock and threw it into the river.         |

| CASE #30: The Murdered Stockbroker |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
|   A distraught lady, Miss Mary Rosedale, has come to see Sherlock Holmes.   |
| Her employer, Jonathan Bailey of the brokerage firm of Bailey &             |
| Coopersfield, was murdered last night. Miss Rosedale is upset because       |
| Bailey's wife, Jenny, seems unconcerned by the murder and because Miss      |
| Rosedale, aside from being his secretary, was also Bailey's mistress.       |
|   Jonathan Bailey was shot outside the Tobacconist after leaving work. A    |
| bullet pierced his heart. By the time help arrived, the assailant had       |
| already vanished. Scotland Yard has been called in, but they have made      |
| little progress in the case. Therefore, Miss Rosedale wants Holmes to bring |
| this crime to justice.                                                      |
|   Miss Rosedale says that Jonathan Bailey had been under pressure lately,   |
| both at work and at home. A scoundrel of a competitor, Henry Lancelot, has  |
| been trying to drive Bailey's brokerage firm out of business by             |
| undercutting its prices. At home, Jenny has started drinking heavily of     |
| late. Jonathan had been very concerned about this.                          |
|   The following information is given regarding the brokerage firm: Bailey's |
| business partner was Barry Coopersfield, an old friend. Rosedale was their  |
| secretary. The firm also employs a timid scrivener, Lionel Reinfield. The   |
| brokerage house is located close to the Dock, but much business is also     |
| carried out over lunch at the Hotel.                                        |
|   To solve this case, Holmes must discover a) who murdered Jonathan Bailey, |
| b) the motive, and c) where the murder weapon is.                           |
|   The game is afoot!                                                        |

| convinced Bailey that they should buy an insurance policy in case either of |
| them died, with the surviving partner getting the insurance money. After    |
| the policy was taken out, Coopersfield took his souvenir western "six-gun"  |
| revolver, followed Bailey after work, and shot him outside the Tobacconist. |
| Coopersfield then went to the Wild West Show at the Playhouse. Posing as a  |
| stagehand, he snuck into the prop room and put his revolver in a prop bin   |
| containing other revolvers from the show.                                   |
